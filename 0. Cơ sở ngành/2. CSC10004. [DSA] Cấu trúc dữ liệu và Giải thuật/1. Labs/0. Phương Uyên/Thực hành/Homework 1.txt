Implement the operations/functions removeAll, removeBefore, removeAfter, addPos, removePos, addBefore, addAfter, reverseList, and removeDuplicate from the Singly Linked List section using the DNODE and DList structs defined in the Doubly Linked List section.
Implement all operations/functions from the Stack - Queue section.
OOP: initialize(int key), push(int key), enqueue(int key).
Procedural: initializeStack(Stack& s, int key), push(Stack &s, int key), isEmptyStack(Stack s). Similar for Queue.
For other operations/functions, keep the original name (no parameters).
Implement the main function that demonstrates the usage of your implemented functions.
